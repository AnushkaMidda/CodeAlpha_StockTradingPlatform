# CodeAlpha_StockTradingPlatform
A Java-based Stock Trading Platform built during my CodeAlpha internship. It allows users to simulate stock trading by viewing market prices, buying/selling stocks, and tracking portfolio performance. The project demonstrates core Java concepts like OOP, collections, and real-time data simulation through a simple console-based interface.
