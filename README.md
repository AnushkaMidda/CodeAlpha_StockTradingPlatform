# CodeAlpha_StockTradingPlatform

A **Java-based Stock Trading Platform** built as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship Task 2**.

This project simulates a basic stock trading environment through a **console-based application**, allowing users to:

* 💹 View real-time simulated **market stock prices**
* 🛒 **Buy** and **Sell** stocks using virtual currency
* 📊 Track their **portfolio performance**, including total value and balance
* 🧠 Understand core **Java concepts** like:

  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * Collections (`HashMap`)
  * Real-time data simulation (`Math.random()`)
